This "AXIS-SDK-Unity-RealtimeRascals-Sample" demo project for AXIS is done with "The Realtime Rascals" sample by Unity.

We wanted to show how AXIS can enable users to control 3D characters in Unity real-time.
This is a use-case we have identified for users of AXIS for full body motion tracking.

Note: Added bonus is the Face tracking if you have an iPhone.
